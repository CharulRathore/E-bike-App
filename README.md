This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to run the project?
1. Set up NodeJS and 'npm'.
2. Set up AWS CLI.
3. Create an S3 Bucket.
4. Clone this repository.
5. Open two terminals, one for the Frontend and the other for the Backend.
6. CD to the Backend folder in one of the Terminal and run -

### `npm install`
### `npm run dev`
You should see -> Server listening on port 4000
